Determining the greatest all-around NBA shooter is subjective and often depends on personal preferences and biases. However, as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, several players are widely regarded as some of the greatest shooters in NBA history.

Stephen Curry, a guard for the Golden State Warriors, is often considered one of the greatest shooters of all time. His incredible three-point shooting ability, both in terms of volume and accuracy, has revolutionized the game. Curry's deep range, quick release, and ability to create shots off the dribble make him a unique and exceptional shooter.

Other notable names often mentioned in discussions about the greatest NBA shooters include Ray Allen, known for his clutch shooting and smooth stroke, and Reggie Miller, who was a prolific three-point shooter during his career with the Indiana Pacers.

It's essential to note that the evaluation of the greatest shooter can vary based on individual criteria, playing eras, and personal preferences. Players like Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and others also deserve consideration in these discussions. Additionally, new players may have emerged or existing players may have further solidified their positions since my last update.
